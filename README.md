#Anna's Reflection - A Thrilling Adventure 
From point click smart-phone games to triple-A quality console games, escape puzzles formed a cultural game niche aimed to entertain players through the feeling of accomplishment and appreciation of their intelligence.

Our group is determined to create a PC game aimed to target audience that is explained above. We wanted to create a game with unique mechanics and an unforgettable story. We wanted to show the story of our main character, Anna, and her magical dark world.
 Description

Anna’s Reflection is a single player, offline, first person, room escape/adventure game powered by Unity and will be made for PC.  It has a 3D environment where the player has to interact with his reflection in order to solve the puzzles. Unlike of its kinds, Anna’s Reflection features two kinds of environments: The real room, and its reflection, which we also call, the imaginary room.

Our main character, Anna, can control her own reflection by interacting with mirrors or anything that reflects her image. The basic idea behind the puzzles is to make player entering the imaginary room to find some clues, search for hidden items or solve problems that do not exist in the real room. The imaginary rooms are symmetric to the real rooms (with some exceptions) which the symmetry is calculated by the placement of mirrors, thus the direction of gravity may not be same in every room. Rooms, puzzles and the lore will be uniquely designed to pull the players in its environment to create an unforgettable adventure.

The uniqueness of Anna’s Reflection comes from the mechanics of the gameplay. Unlike many puzzle games, moving from a real character to its identical copy through its reflection is somehow challenging to understand at the beginning. But as the player progresses through the levels, puzzles will require this mechanic to be solved. With the usage of time limitations, thrilling environments and a feeling of loneliness, the player will feel the sense of fear and it affects his / her decisions.
